# Genetic Algorithm

If there is a problem with opening `GA.cpp` with Dev-C++, you might need to use other text editors such as Visual Studio.

To generate the `.exe` file with manual C++ compilation:
```sh
g++ -o GA.exe GA.cpp
```
```sh
g++ -o PSO.exe PSO.cpp
```

# TODO

# DONE

- float -> double
- lFv -> double type max value
- #define MINI_PROJECT (Project -> 1 | Assignment 0 -> 0 | Demo -> -1 | Manual -> -2)
