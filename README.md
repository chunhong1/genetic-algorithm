# Genetic Algorithm

If there is a problem with opening `GA.cpp` with Dev-C++, you might need to use other text editors such as Visual Studio.

To generate the `.exe` file with manual C++ compilation:
```sh
g++ -o GA.exe GA.cpp
```

# TODO
- demo color
- start stop clock (auto data type?) -> more accurate execution times

# DONE
19/8
- float -> double
- lFv -> double type max value
