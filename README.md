If there is a problem with opening `GA.cpp` with Dev-C++, you might need to use other text editors such as Visual Studio.

To generate the `.exe` file with manual C++ compilation:
```sh
g++ -o GA.exe GA.cpp
```

# Brandon TODO
- demo color
- start stop clock (auto data type?) -> more accurate execution times
- float -> double OR long double
- lvFit - > change coding or max value
- manual ver -> resetExperiment() update
