# Genetic Algorithm

If there are problem with opening `GA.cpp` or `PSO.cpp` with Dev-C++, you might need to use other text editors.

To generate the `.exe` file with manual C++ compilation:
```sh
g++ -o GA.exe GA.cpp
```
```sh
g++ -o PSO.exe PSO.cpp
```

- PSO -> Determine and confirm constants value w, c1, c2
